# AI-based Diagnostic Model for Dementia Classification

## Overview

This repository contains my understanding and code of the paper -  [AI-based diagnostic model for dementia classification](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03118-z). The project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly using MRI data, to classify different types of dementia and cognitive states.

This is an assignment for [CogAI4Sci](https://www.cogai4sci.com/) AI lab internship at NUS
